MonieO is an experimental cryptocurrency which uses a simple yet functional blockchain implementation and protocol in order to easy to learn and build upon for beginners and enthusiasts alike.

If you are looking to try MonieO, you might want to look at the [Usage Guide](https://github.com/Symphonic3/MonieO/wiki/Usage-Guide) and the [Beginner Info](https://github.com/Symphonic3/MonieO/wiki/Beginner-Info)

Compatibility
=========

MonieO was originally designed to be as portable as possible but we have decided to use RandomX for PoW which requires system-specific binaries. Due to this, MonieO currently supports only Windows on the 64bit (x86-64) architecture. If you want to run MonieO on a different system, compile the required RandomX binaries you need for your system yourself, or [open an issue](https://github.com/Symphonic3/MonieO/issues/new/choose) and we will attempt to make the binaries available.

Specifications
=========

| Specification | Type |
|---------------|------|
| Proof Algorithm | RandomX PoW |
| Block time | 1 minute |
| Total (theoretical) supply | 21,000,000 MNO |
| P2P network port | 21093 |
